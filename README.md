# DIPFinalProject-Cartoonify
Digital Image Processing Final Project. We used machine learning algorithms to detect faces in images, then used EDSR super resolution to scale the faces up. From there, we overlayed the new face onto the original image, and used Gauissian blurring/smoothing/filtering to give the image a "sketched" look, the idea being it's a free caricature.
